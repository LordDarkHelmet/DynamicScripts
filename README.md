<b>Scripts for the Dynamic (DYN) Cryptocurrency</b>

Setup a Dynode with one line! You can generate a pairing key from any wallet using the <code>dynode genkey</code> command. We recomend Ubuntu 16.04 as the OS, but any version is compatible. 

<code>wget -N https://github.com/LordDarkHelmet/DynamicScripts/releases/download/v1.0.0/dynSimpleSetup.sh && sudo sh dynSimpleSetup.sh -d ReplaceMeWithOutputFrom_dynode_genkey</code>

You can also setup a dynamic miner with one line! Example: (<i>be sure to replace the address with your scrape address</i>)

<code>wget -N https://github.com/LordDarkHelmet/DynamicScripts/releases/download/v1.0.0/dynSimpleSetup.sh && sudo sh dynSimpleSetup.sh -s D9T2NVLGZEFSw3yc6ye4BenfK7n356wudR</code>

The script can: 
 * Create remote dynodes
 * Create miners
 * Auto Scrapes
 * Auto Updates
 * Watchdog to keep the mining going just in case of a crash
 * Startup on reboot

This is a collection of scripts that will assist users in setting up and managing instances of the dynamic wallet.

<b>dynSimpleSetup.sh</b>
This script is used in conjunction with the dynStartupScript.sh script. It is a non, or rarely changing script that will pull the latest dynStartupScript.sh script and run it. This allows us to have a static location for a release script so we can use one line startup commands while always running the latest script. 

<b>dynStartupScript.sh:</b>
This script is a one stop shop. Run it on your VPS and it will do everything hands off. It will mine for you, it will scrape for you, it will auto update when new versions come out, it can even setup a dynode for you. Simple and easy. If you set it as a startup script, you will never need to log into your VPS.
